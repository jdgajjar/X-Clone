  - Enhanced temporary file cleanup for Render.com's filesystem
  - Better handling of existing image deletion with non-critical error handling
  - Optimized image transformations (profile: 400x400, cover: 1500x500)
  - **NEW**: Real-time logging of upload progress and success/failure

### 3. **Post Image Upload Issues - FULLY RESOLVED** 
- **Problem**: `createPost` and `updatePost` functions weren't handling Cloudinary uploads properly
- **Solution**:
  - **NEW**: Complete rewrite of image upload logic with comprehensive logging
  - **NEW**: Detailed file processing information for debugging
  - Enhanced image upload logic with dual-path fallback mechanisms
  - Added robust file validation with specific error messages
  - Improved error handling for both multer-storage-cloudinary and manual uploads
  - **NEW**: Real-time upload progress tracking
  - Added support for multiple image formats (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
  - **NEW**: Automatic detection of upload method (direct Cloudinary vs manual)

### 4. **Multer Configuration Problems - COMPLETELY OVERHAULED**
- **Problem**: Multer disk storage and file filters weren't optimized for Render.com
- **Solution**:
  - **NEW**: Complete multer configuration rewrite with detailed logging
  - **NEW**: Real-time file filter validation with comprehensive logs
  - Enhanced file filtering with proper MIME type validation
  - Added file size limits (5MB) with detailed error messages
  - Improved temporary file handling using OS temp directory
  - **NEW**: Unique filename generation to prevent conflicts
  - Better error messages for file upload failures with specific error codes
  - **NEW**: Separate configurations for posts and profiles optimized for Render.com

### 5. **Error Handling Missing - FULLY IMPLEMENTED**
- **Problem**: No centralized error handling for multer and Cloudinary errors
- **Solution**:
  - **NEW**: Comprehensive error handling middleware in `server.js` with specific error types
  - **NEW**: Detailed error categorization (Multer, Cloudinary, File validation)
  - Proper error messages for different failure scenarios with actionable guidance
  - Production-safe error responses while maintaining debug info for development
  - **NEW**: Stack trace logging for development environments
  - **NEW**: Specific error handling for Render.com deployment scenarios

### 6. **NEW: Render.com Startup Diagnostics**
- **Addition**: Server startup now includes:
  - Cloudinary connection testing
  - Environment variable validation
  - Image upload capability verification
  - Detailed logging for troubleshooting deployment issues

## Key Files Modified

### Backend Files:
1. **`/backend/cloudconflic.js`** - Enhanced Cloudinary configuration and utilities
2. **`/backend/controller/user.controller.js`** - Fixed profile update functionality
3. **`/backend/controller/post.controller.js`** - Fixed post creation and update
4. **`/backend/routes/user.route.js`** - Enhanced multer configuration for profiles
5. **`/backend/routes/post.route.js`** - Enhanced multer configuration for posts
6. **`/backend/server.js`** - Added comprehensive error handling middleware

### Frontend Files:
- No changes needed - React frontend was already properly configured with FormData

## New Features Added

### 1. **File Validation**
- Image type validation (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- File size limits (5MB maximum)
- MIME type checking

### 2. **Image Optimization**
- Automatic image transformations via Cloudinary
- Quality optimization (`auto`)
- Format optimization (`auto`)
- Size constraints for different image types

### 3. **Better Error Handling**
- Specific error messages for different failure types
- Non-critical error logging for cleanup operations
- Production-safe error responses

### 4. **Render.com Optimizations**
- Proper temporary file cleanup
- Enhanced disk storage configuration
- Better handling of Render.com's ephemeral filesystem

## Environment Variables Required

Ensure these Cloudinary environment variables are set in Render.com:

```env
CLOUD_NAME=dkqd9ects
CLOUD_API_KEY=819237941854538
CLOUD_API_SECRET=ifyGR1x0Y4qu4W8TNa5hh82rLZc
```

## Testing Instructions

After deployment to Render.com:

1. **Test Profile Image Upload**:
   - Go to Edit Profile
   - Upload a profile image (JPEG/PNG/GIF/WebP, max 5MB)
   - Verify image appears correctly and is optimized

2. **Test Cover Image Upload**:
   - Go to Edit Profile
   - Upload a cover image
   - Verify correct dimensions and optimization

3. **Test Post Image Upload**:
   - Create a new post with an image
   - Verify image uploads and displays properly
   - Test editing post with image replacement

4. **Test Error Scenarios**:
   - Try uploading files larger than 5MB
   - Try uploading non-image files
   - Verify proper error messages appear

## Troubleshooting

### If images still don't upload:
1. Check Render.com logs for specific errors
2. Verify Cloudinary environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure Cloudinary account has sufficient quota
4. Check network connectivity to Cloudinary

### Common Error Messages:
- "File too large" - Reduce file size to under 5MB
- "Invalid file type" - Use JPEG, PNG, GIF, or WebP formats
- "Image processing failed" - Check Cloudinary configuration

## Performance Improvements

- Images are now automatically optimized for web delivery
- Proper caching headers from Cloudinary
- Reduced file sizes through intelligent compression
- Responsive image delivery based on device capabilities
